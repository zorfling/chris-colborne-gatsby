Running some code after changing state is a common desire. Let's look at how to do that with hooks.

## Method 1 - useEffect hook

The first and most commonly used method to run a function after updating state is the `useEffect` hook. `useEffect` runs its function only when the items in the dependency array change. Sounds pretty spot on for what we want huh? Let's see it in action:

```js
const [name, setName] = useState('John Doe');
useEffect(() => {
  // run something every time name changes
  console.log(name);
}, [name]); // <-- dependency array
```

Pretty simple, every time `name` changes, we'll run the function, which `console.log`s the name out. 

## Method 2 - useReducer hook

When you find yourself needing more complex state updates, where updating one item of state affects another item of state, you can reach for `useReducer`.

What if we had a status, and wanted to save a history of the last 10 statuses? Because the history relies on changes to the status, `useReducer` would be a good choice here. Let's see it in action:

```js
const CHANGE_STATE = 'CHANGE_STATE';
const CLEAR_HISTORY = 'CLEAR_HISTORY';
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  const { status, history } = state;
  const { type, newStatus } = action;

  switch (type) {
    case CHANGE_STATE:
      return { status: newStatus, history: [...history, status] };
    case CLEAR_HISTORY:
      return { status, history: [] };
    default:
      break;
  }
};
export const StatusHistory = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, {
    status: 'stopped',
    history: []
  });
  const start = () => dispatch({ type: CHANGE_STATE, newStatus: 'started' });
  const finish = () => dispatch({ type: CHANGE_STATE, newStatus: 'finished' });
  const clear = () => dispatch({ type: CLEAR_HISTORY });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current status: {state.status}</p>
      <ul>
        {state.history.map((previousStatus) => (
          <li>{previousStatus}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <button onClick={start}>Start it</button>
      <button onClick={finish}>Finish it</button>
      <button onClick={clear}>Clear History</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The end
