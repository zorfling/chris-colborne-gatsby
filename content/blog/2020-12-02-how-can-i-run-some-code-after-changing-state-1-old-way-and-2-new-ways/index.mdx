Running some code after changing state is a common desire. Let's look at how to do that with hooks. If you're not careful you can find yourself with an infinite loop.

# ---
## First The Old Way

If you're still using classes for your components, you're in luck. The class component `setState` has a callback just for this reason. It takes the following form:

```js
this.setState({ myState: 'updatedState' }, () => {
  // do something after the re-render here
  console.log(this.state.myState);
}
```

NB: it's recommended to use componentDidUpdate for this sort of logic, but it does exist here anyway

## Method 1 - useEffect

The first and most commonly used method to run a function after updating state is the `useEffect` hook. `useEffect` runs its function only when the items in the dependency array change. Sounds pretty spot on for what we want huh? Let's see it in action:

```js
const [name, setName] = useState('John Doe');
useEffect(() => {
  // run something every time name changes
  console.log(name);
}, [name]); // <-- dependency array
``` 

Pretty simple, every time `name` changes, we'll run the function, which `console.log`s the name out. 

### Gotcha 1 - useEffect infinite loops

Logging out the state is a pretty contrived example. 

What if we had a status and wanted to save a history of the previous steps:

```js

```

## Method 2 - useReducer

When you find yourself needing more complex state updates, where updating one item of state affects another item of state, you can reach for `useReducer`.
