In TypeScript, there are a few ways to type functions. But did you know that using the method syntax to define your functions in TypeScript is not type safe?

\--

There are three main ways you can type a function in Typescript.

The most common and recommended way is to type it as an arrow function:

```ts
interface MyObj {
  add: (a:number, b: number) => number
}
```

Another less common way is as a call signature. This is often useful if the function has properties as well as being callable.

```ts
interface MyObj {
  add: {
    coolMetadata: string,
    (a: number, b: number): number
  }
}
```

The final way is as a method signature. This often makes sense when talking about classes, but is also valid for interfaces.

```ts
class MyCalculator {
  add(a: number, b: number): number;
}

interface WithAdd {
  add(a: number, b: number): number;
}
```

But did you know if you use the method signature syntax (#3 above), it's actually not completely typesafe. 

The [`strictFunctionTypes` flag in TSConfig](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictFunctionTypes), when enabled (as it is with `strict: true`), causes functions parameters to be checked more correctly.

However from the docs: 

> During development of this feature, we discovered a large number of inherently unsafe class hierarchies, including some in the DOM. Because of this, the setting only applies to functions written in function syntax, not to those in method syntax.

https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictFunctionTypes

That means, if you type your function with the method syntax, `strictFunctionTypes` does not apply! In particular, when you're assigning a more specific type to a less specific type, it isn't flagged.

Let's see an example.

```ts
interface PrintMethod {
  print(a: string | number): string;
}

interface PrintFunction {
  print: (a: string | number) => string;
}

interface PrintCall {
  print: {
    (a: string | number): string
  }
}

const printFunc = (a: string) => 'hello';

const MyAddingMethod: PrintMethod = {
   print: printFunc // uh oh - this isn't flagged as an error
}

const MyAddingFunction: PrintFunction = {
   print: printFunc // this is correctly flagged
}

const MyAddingCall: PrintCall = {
   print: printFunc // this is correctly flagged
}
```

It's not all bad news - it will correctly catch it if the type changes completely, however I'd argue that having it sometimes work is actually probably worse than always fail. 

So anyway, long story short, don't use method syntax. Always use the function syntax (or the call signature if you need the additional properties) and your code will be much type-safer for it!
