Gatsby is an awesome static site generator, but you need to get your data from somewhere. What are your options for headless CMSs?

## What is Gatsby?

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. It basically bashes together React, GraphQL and the so called JAM Stack to make some serious awesomeness.

## What is a headless CMS?

In this new JAM Stack world, your CMS backend and your frontend site are split. A headless CMS is simply a CMS which instead of pumping out HTML and CSS views, produces an API. There are many options, from trusty old WordPress, to open source, to paid SaaS options.

## What are the options?

### Open source options

* [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
* [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)
* [Keystone](https://www.keystonejs.com/)
* [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org)

### SaaS

* [Prismic](https://prismic.io/)
* [Sanity](https://sanity.io/)
* [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
* [Forestry](https://www.forestry.io/)

## Which one should you use?

Like everything, it depends! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If it's a commercial site, you've got the money, or really just want something turnkey, then choose one of the SaaS options. I've heard good things about Sanity and Contentful.

If it's a simple blog, Netlify CMS will do great. (in fact I'm using it for this blog!)

If it's a bigger site / application, give a more full powered solution a go such as Keystone or Strapi.

And if you need to work with clients, you might be stuck with WordPress, but at least you can have some shiny front end tech and they get the benefits of a performant, secure site.
