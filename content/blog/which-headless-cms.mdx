## What is Gatsby?



## What is a headless CMS?



## What are the options?

### Open source options

* [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
* [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)
* [Keystone](https://www.keystonejs.com/)
* [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org)

### SaaS

* [Prismic](https://prismic.io/)
* [Sanity](https://sanity.io/)
* [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
* [Forestry](https://www.forestry.io/)

## Which one should you use?

Like everything, it depends! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If it's a commercial site, you've got the money, or really just want something turnkey, then choose one of the SaaS options. I'd recommend Contentful

If it's a simple blog, Netlify CMS will do great. (in fact I'm using it for this blog!)

If it's a bigger site / application, give a more full powered solution a go such as Keystone.

And if you need to work with clients, you might be stuck with WordPress, but at least you can have some shiny front end tech and they get the benefits of a performant, secure site.
