Gatsby is an awesome static site generator, but you need to get your data from somewhere. What are your options for headless CMSs?

## What is Gatsby?

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. It basically bashes together React, GraphQL and the so called JAM Stack to make some serious awesomeness.

## What is the JAM Stack?

The JAM Stack is a name standing for a modern way of building sites/apps with JavaScript, APIs and Markup. Commonly it involves server side generated code from Markdown and/or API endpoints. 

## What is a headless CMS?

In this new JAM Stack world, your CMS backend and your frontend site are split. A headless CMS is simply a CMS which instead of pumping out HTML and CSS views, produces an API. There are many options, from trusty old WordPress, to open source, to paid SaaS options.

## What are the options?

### Open source options

* [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)

  Netlify is one of the most common hosting providers for the JAM stack. They've built an open source SPA which you can install as an NPM module on your site to provide a CMS experience over GitHub and Markdown, complete with editorial workflow using pull requests.
* [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)

  Strapi is an open source, self hosted headless CMS written in Node. It provides both a REST and GraphQL endpoint, with a customisable admin portal and API.
* [Keystone](https://www.keystonejs.com/)
* [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org)

### SaaS

* [Prismic](https://prismic.io/)
* [Sanity](https://sanity.io/)
* [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
* [Forestry](https://www.forestry.io/)

## Which one should you use?

Like everything, it depends! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If it's a commercial site, you've got the money, or really just want something turnkey, then choose one of the SaaS options. I've heard good things about Sanity and Contentful.

If it's a simple blog, Netlify CMS will do great. (in fact I'm using it for this blog!)

If it's a bigger site / application, give a more full powered solution a go such as Keystone or Strapi.

And if you need to work with clients, you might be stuck with WordPress, but at least you can have some shiny front end tech and they get the benefits of a performant, secure site.
